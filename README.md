## Building a NFT Ticketing app with Paper and Next.js
NFT ticketing is a new method of selling tickets for various events such as concerts, sports games, and festivals. In this system, tickets are represented as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) which are unique digital assets that cannot be duplicated or exchanged for anything else.

When attendee purchases an NFT ticket, they are essentially acquiring a one-of-a-kind digital asset. These tickets are minted on blockchains such as Ethereum, which makes it simple to track ownership and securely transfer them between ticket holders. This means, attendees no longer have to be concerned about fake tickets or scams.

## Why companies are moving towards NFT ticketing
NFT ticketing is gaining traction among companies due to several significant reasons, including:

### Improved Security: 
NFT ticketing offers a high level of security and authenticity that traditional paper or digital tickets cannot match. Each NFT is unique and recorded on a blockchain, making it almost impossible to counterfeit or duplicate.

### Potential for Increased Revenue: 
NFTs are digital assets that can be bought, sold, and traded on secondary markets, creating the potential for ticket resales at higher prices.

### Enhancing the Fan Experience: 
NFTs can grant access to exclusive content, such as backstage meet-and-greets or VIP lounges, improving the fan experience. Additionally, fans can hold onto their NFT tickets as collectibles, providing a memorable experience.

### Environmental Sustainability:
NFT ticketing can reduce environmental impact by eliminating the need for paper tickets, which is becoming increasingly important for environmentally conscious consumers.

## What is Paper?
Paper is a developer platform for NFT commerce. It allows you to accept credit card payments for NFTs, enable users to “connect” to your app with just their email, and airdrop NFTs at scale.
